# Planetary-system
This is MY take on the homework of the planetary system with music which will be included with the files :)

I have made the homework of planetary system where i have made a program with stars that are randomly generated (definitely didn't steal it) where it (VERY SADLY) uses JavaScript for the random generation.

And then here is the version without the stars since i couldn't figure out (for god's sake) on how to make them in CSS without them looking so systematic (i hate to know that i cannot normally make them look good and natural without random) so i just thought of not adding them.

I am sorry if i am not up to the rules that have been made but i just couldn't kick myself into the butt into making them. SO this is my (very best) try at making the planetary system. I sadly couldn't figure out if the shadow follows behind the planets cause i am (very) blind at slight details. There will be two files with sound and different features (meaning) which are stars.
